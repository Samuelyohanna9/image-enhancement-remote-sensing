# Image Enhancement for Remote Sensing

## Description
This project focuses on enhancing the quality of remote sensing data using a **U-Net-based deep learning model**. The goal is to reduce noise and improve change detection accuracy, which is crucial for geospatial analysis and decision-making in applications like environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster management.

The project is inspired by **Mahmoud Afifi's work on learnable camera ISPs** and applies similar principles to remote sensing imagery.

## Features
- **Noise Reduction**: Enhances image quality by reducing noise and artifacts.
- **Change Detection**: Improves the accuracy of detecting changes in remote sensing data over time.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses a U-Net architecture for image enhancement.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Tailored for remote sensing applications, such as land cover classification and feature extraction.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for building and training the U-Net model.
- **Rasterio**: Library for reading and writing geospatial raster data.
- **Scikit-image**: Image processing library for preprocessing and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for running and testing the code.
